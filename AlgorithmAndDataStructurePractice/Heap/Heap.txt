Heap has 3 properties

1) Binary Tree

2) Complete binary tree - ALl levels must be filled completely except last level. And leaf should be added left to right

3) Heap Order property - Parent must be greater than its children at any given element for max heap and reverse in min heap.



//Time complexity
Push - O(nlogn)

Pop - O(nlogn)
Get - O(1)


Heap can be represented using array internally. 

Representing heap data structure in array
    - We can not use 0th index for simplicity
    - Each child of a node will be present at 2i , 2i+1.
     

use greater for minheap,
