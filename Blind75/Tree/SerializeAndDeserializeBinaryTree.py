# Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

# Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

# Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.


# Example 1:


# Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
# Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
# Example 2:

# Input: root = []
# Output: []


# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
# -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000


# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
