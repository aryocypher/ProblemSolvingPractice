# Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

# Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.


# Example 1:

# Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
# Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
# Output: false


# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 300
# 1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000
# 1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20
# s and wordDict[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.
# All the strings of wordDict are unique.

class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
        cache = [0]*(len(s)+1)
        cache[len(s)] = 1

        for i in range(len(s)-1, -1, -1):
            for word in wordDict:
                if i+len(word) <= len(s) and s[i:i+len(word)] == word:
                    cache[i] = cache[i+len(word)]
                    if cache[i]:
                        break

        return cache[0]
