# Description
# Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

# Please implement encode and decode


# Example
# Example1

# Input: ["lint","code","love","you"]
# Output: ["lint","code","love","you"]
# Explanation:
# One possible encode method is: "lint:;code:;love:;you"
# Example2

# Input: ["we", "say", ":", "yes"]
# Output: ["we", "say", ":", "yes"]
# Explanation:
# One possible encode method is: "we:;say:;:::;yes"
